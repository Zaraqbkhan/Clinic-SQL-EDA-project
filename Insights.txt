 Clinic Data Analysis â€“ Project Insights

This exploratory data analysis was performed on a structured SQL dataset simulating clinic operations. The focus areas included patient demographics, appointment behavior, prescription trends, doctor performance, and medication patterns over a period of 7 months and 10 days (May 10 â€“ Dec 20, 2023).

1. Patient Demographics

- A total of 100 patients were recorded, with 80 receiving appointments.
- Gender distribution was equal, ensuring fair access across genders.
- State-wise distribution showed:
- VIC had the highest number of patients (21), followed by NSW and QLD (20 each).
- TAS had the lowest (10), indicating potential outreach or capacity gaps.
- Age groups were evenly split in terms of appointments:
- 18â€“35 years: 51 appointments
- 36â€“60 years: 49 appointments

Recommendation:  
Increase outreach in low-engagement states like TAS and WA to improve overall coverage.


2. Doctor Engagement

- 49 out of 50 doctors handled patients.
- Dr. John Doe led with 7 appointments and 6 prescriptions across 2 patients.
- Most doctors had 1â€“3 appointments, with many only appearing once.
- State-wise doctor counts were highest in NSW (17) and lowest in TAS (6).

Recommendation:
Consider balancing doctor distribution across regions based on patient load to improve efficiency.


3. Appointment Scheduling Patterns

- Most appointments occurred on Wednesdays (23) and Fridays (21).
- Least booked days: Monday (7) and Thursday (4).
- Monthly trends peaked in:
  - September (21) and October (18)
- Most common appointment types:
  - Follow-up appointments(25)
  - Routine checkups and Medication reviews (20 each)

Recommendation:
Use peak-day data to plan staffing and allocate resources. Consider shifting non-urgent appointments to less busy days.



4. Prescription & Medication Trends

- Only 12 patients received prescriptions, each getting 3 medications, totaling 36 prescriptions.
- Medications were primarily focused on:
  - Pain relief & inflammation: Ibuprofen, Meloxicam, Hydrocodone
  - Mental health: Antidepressants (e.g., Venlafaxine, Fluoxetine), anti-anxiety meds (Lorazepam, Diazepam)
  - Chronic care: Blood pressure meds, diabetes, thyroid treatments
  - Antibiotics: Amoxicillin, Azithromycin, Ciprofloxacin

Recommendation:  
Monitor and assess medication usage trends to ensure consistency in treatment strategies, particularly in managing pain and mental health.

5. Medication Usage by Age Group

- 18â€“35 age group received the most varied prescriptions:
  - Antibiotics, antihistamines, antidepressants, and pain relief
  - Also prescribed sleep aids, antipsychotics, and chronic condition meds
- 36â€“60 age group had focused prescriptions:
  - Antidepressants, blood pressure meds, and asthma-related treatments

**ðŸ“Œ Recommendation:  
Introduce preventative care initiatives targeting younger patients who show early signs of chronic conditions or mental health needs.
