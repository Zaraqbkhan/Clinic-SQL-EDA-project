# 📊 Clinic Data Analysis – Project Insights

This exploratory data analysis was performed on a structured SQL dataset simulating clinic operations. The focus areas included patient demographics, appointment behavior, prescription trends, doctor performance, and medication patterns over a period of 7 months and 10 days (May 10 – Dec 20, 2023).

---

## 🧍‍♂️ Patient Demographics

- A total of **100 patients** were recorded, with **80** receiving appointments.
- **Gender distribution was equal**, ensuring fair access across genders.
- **State-wise distribution** showed:
  - VIC had the highest number of patients (21), followed by NSW and QLD (20 each).
  - TAS had the lowest (10), indicating potential outreach or capacity gaps.
- **Age groups** were evenly split in terms of appointments:
  - 18–35 years: 51 appointments
  - 36–60 years: 49 appointments

**📌 Recommendation:**  
Increase outreach in low-engagement states like TAS and WA to improve overall coverage.


## 🩺 Doctor Engagement

- **49 out of 50 doctors** handled patients.
- **Dr. John Doe** led with 7 appointments and 6 prescriptions across 2 patients.
- Most doctors had 1–3 appointments, with many only appearing once.
- State-wise doctor counts were highest in **NSW (17)** and lowest in **TAS (6)**.

**📌 Recommendation:**  
Consider balancing doctor distribution across regions based on patient load to improve efficiency.

## 🗓️ Appointment Scheduling Patterns

- **Most appointments** occurred on **Wednesdays (23)** and **Fridays (21)**.
- **Least booked days**: **Monday (7)** and **Thursday (4)**.
- Monthly trends peaked in:
  - **September (21)** and **October (18)**
- Most common appointment types:
  - **Follow-up appointments** (25)
  - **Routine checkups** and **Medication reviews** (20 each)

**📌 Recommendation:**  
Use peak-day data to plan staffing and allocate resources. Consider shifting non-urgent appointments to less busy days.

## 💊 Prescription & Medication Trends

- Only **12 patients** received prescriptions, each getting **3 medications**, totaling 36 prescriptions.
- Medications were primarily focused on:
  - **Pain relief & inflammation**: Ibuprofen, Meloxicam, Hydrocodone
  - **Mental health**: Antidepressants (e.g., Venlafaxine, Fluoxetine), anti-anxiety meds (Lorazepam, Diazepam)
  - **Chronic care**: Blood pressure meds, diabetes, thyroid treatments
  - **Antibiotics**: Amoxicillin, Azithromycin, Ciprofloxacin

**📌 Recommendation:**  
Monitor and assess medication usage trends to ensure consistency in treatment strategies, particularly in managing pain and mental health.

## 🎯 Medication Usage by Age Group

- **18–35 age group** received the most varied prescriptions:
  - Antibiotics, antihistamines, antidepressants, and pain relief
  - Also prescribed sleep aids, antipsychotics, and chronic condition meds
- **36–60 age group** had focused prescriptions:
  - Antidepressants, blood pressure meds, and asthma-related treatments

**📌 Recommendation:**  
Introduce preventative care initiatives targeting younger patients who show early signs of chronic conditions or mental health needs.

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

This analysis highlights key operational and clinical insights from SQL-based exploration of the clinic’s data. It provides a basis for:

- Strategic staff planning  
- Treatment standardization  
- Regional engagement improvements  
- Age-specific patient care optimization
## 📌 Data-Driven Recommendations

- 📍 **Balance Doctor Distribution:** Hire or reassign doctors in under-covered regions like TAS and WA to improve accessibility.

- 🗓️ **Optimize Scheduling:** Encourage bookings on less busy days (Mon/Thu) to reduce mid-week overload.

- 🧠 **Strengthen Mental Health Services:** Increase support for young adults, who receive a high number of antidepressant and anxiety-related prescriptions.

- 📅 **Plan for Seasonal Peaks:** Boost staffing or extend hours during high-traffic months like September and October.

- 🩺 **Focus on Preventive Care:** Target the 18–35 age group with health awareness and screening initiatives.

- 💊 **Audit Prescription Practices:** Ensure consistency and safety in treatment plans where multiple medications are prescribed.
